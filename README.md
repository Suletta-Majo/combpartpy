# combpartpy
I plan to combine the main Python program written in an appropriate split
------------------------------------------

### Usage  
rename your separated main program files   
*****.part0~99.py  
put this combpartpy.py same directory and run  
this program create combined copy those files in one  
part0 is basefile,other files [from and import] not copy  

note
It's not a well-designed program,  
so if you're unlucky, it may break unexpectedly :o
