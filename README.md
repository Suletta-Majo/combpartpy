# combpartpy
I plan to combine the main Python program written in an appropriate split
------------------------------------------

### Usage  
rename your separated main program files   
*****.part0~99.py  
put this combpartpy.py same directory and run  
this program create combined copy those files in one  
part0 is basefile,other files [from and import] not copy  

note
It's not a well-designed program,  
so if you're unlucky, it may break unexpectedly :o  


Cases where comments are made into multiple lines by line breaks  
It does not correspond to the presence of 'from' or 'import' at the beginning of the line. 
It's like being in the ohmain.part2.py of sample
